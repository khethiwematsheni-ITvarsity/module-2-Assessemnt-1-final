                    <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, 
                        large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, 
                        greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among other uses. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be left- or right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear. 
                        Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.</p>
                    <p>Two genetically different African species exist: the savanna elephant and the forest elephant, with a number of characteristics that differentiate them both. The African savanna elephant is the largest elephant species, while the Asian forest elephant and the 
                        African forest elephant are of a comparable, smaller size.
                        Asian elephants differ in several ways from their African relatives, with more than 10 distinct physical differences between them. For example, Asian elephants' ears are smaller compared to the large fan-shaped ears of the African species. Only some male Asian elephants have tusks,
                        while both male and female African elephants grow tusks.</p>
                       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
